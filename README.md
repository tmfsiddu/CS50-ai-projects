# CS50 AI Projects

This repository contains my solutions to problem sets from  
**CS50’s Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python (Harvard University)**.

## Important Note
These projects are based on **distribution code provided by CS50**.
All implementations and logic inside the solution files were written by me
as part of the coursework.

## Projects Included
- Degrees (Graph Search – BFS)
- Minesweeper (Logical Inference)
- PageRank (Probability & Iteration)
- Nim (Reinforcement Learning)
- Traffic (CNN using TensorFlow)
- Attention / Mask (Natural Language Processing)

## Technologies Used
- Python
- NumPy
- TensorFlow
- Scikit-learn
- Graph Algorithms
- Reinforcement Learning
- NLP
